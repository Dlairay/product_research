After owning mine for about a week and a half and using it between 2-8 hours a day I think my body is adjusting to sitting properly on the chair. But once I got the lumbar set correctly (I also purchased the memory foam lumber pillow) I’ve been quite comfortable in the chair, Sitting straight up in it which is something I’ve never done. When I was thinking of buying a SL Titan a few years ago I got scared because of people saying it’s like sitting on concrete.","1

Personally I'm not convinced of this, I never had issues sitting extended periods in softer chairs, and find them generally more comfortable. Even after 5.5 years of sitting in my stiff SL Titan, I still find myself pleasantly surprised when I sit in another chair and sink into an actual soft cushion. I will just sit in it until it disintegrates and then buy an entirely different chair, and it won't be a Secretlab chair to be honest.","0
