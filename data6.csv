Reasons to avoid

✅ You highly value postural health: The Herman Miller x Logitech Embody is well worth its asking price given its incredible ergonomic design and supportive features.

✅ You don't want to assemble your gaming chair: You won't have to get on your hands and knees with all kinds of tools to put this chair together as it's ready to roll straight out of the box."
12,https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/asus-rog-destrier,"Bottom Line

The Asus ROG Destrier is a great chair, with plenty of available adjustments to fit your body. The materials used throughout the chair are high quality, with a mixture of plastic, polyurethane foam, mesh, padded cloth, and aluminum. I particularly liked the adjustable lumbar support to aid my aging back, and the extending headrest proved to be comfortable for long workdays. [...] Upholstery | High-tension mesh, PU foam
Total Height (with base) | 50.78 - 54.25 inches / 129 - 138 cm
Floor to Seat Height | 18.5 - 21.5 inches / 47 - 55 cm
Armrest Adjustments | 3D
Recline | Backrest adjustability 90 - 135 degrees
Backrest Length (not including headrest) | 25 inches / 63 cm
Backrest Width (Shoulder Level) | 14 inches / 36 cm
Seating Area Width (total) | 22.44 inches / 57 cm
Seating Area Depth | 19.68 inches / 50 cm
Armrest Width | 4 inches / 10.16 cm [...] However, I can’t argue with the comfort of the Destrier; the chair pampered my butt and back. In addition, the chair just looks so damn cool without being garish. Picking a gaming chair is a personal decision, much more so than a more analytical purchase like the best graphics card for gaming or the best CPU for gaming. But if you can get past the price and some niggling issues, the Asus ROG Destrier would make an excellent addition to any gamer’s hardware arsenal."

GTPlayer GT800A Footrest

The GTPlayer GT800A Footrest, a budget-friendly gaming chair, delivers solid comfort and adjustability with movable lumbar and neck pillows strapped to the chair. Its footrest boosts leg support and leisure. A tester said, “It's satisfactorily comfortable for up to 5 hours of gaming.” Unlike the AndaSeat Kaiser 3, it lacks tilt but offers a steep recline for naps between sessions. [...] The backrest cradles you in a racing seat style, replacing stiff bolsters with comfy foam. It's lumbar support swivels with your turns, adjusting up/down and in/out beyond most systems, while 4D armrests swivel and rise for mobile gaming. Tester Austin Palmer says, “The neck pillow's cushiness is luxurious.” Setup takes just 10 minutes, making the Iskur V2 a standout."

The chair's back can be tilted forward or reclined far back by pulling another lever on the seat's right side. And, finally, the entire chair can freely tilt back, or lock at a given angle."

20,https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-gaming-chairs/,"All our panel testers found the wide armrests on the Respawn 110 unusable and said the seat padding was too thin. It also lacks lumbar support and headrest cushioning, and only the height and recline angle are adjustable.

The N-Gen Gaming Chair has no headrest support and no recline, and the backrest is very short. The armrests are also wide, low, and non-adjustable. [...] It’s the most comfortable chair we tested at this price or lower. Our testers ranked the Ace Pro higher than any other cheap gaming chair we evaluated. The firm backrest has thinner padding in comparison with our other picks, but the seat cushion kept my legs from getting sore longer than some options that cost three times as much. We also liked the padding on the armrests, which offered a comfortable alternative to the hard plastic on many other models. [...] Most of our testers, friends, and family liked the Secretlab Titan Evo right away. I sat comfortably in this chair for hours without getting sore in my lower body or back, and you can easily make many adjustments to it while seated.

DXRacer Craft review: Price and availability [...] The DXRacer Craft is a good gaming chair for those seeking some cool visual themes, extremely easy assembly and excellent overall build quality. Its infuriating headrest adjustment and lack of any unique features keep it from landing at the top of our list, but it's still quite a comfortable option within its price range.

Pros

Great build quality

Plenty comfortable

Lots of color and theme options

Cons

Awful headrest adjustment

A bit too much front-side branding [...] In terms of functionality, the DXRacer Craft offers pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a mid-range gaming chair. You get standard 2D lumbar support that can be adjusted using a knob on the side of the chair, the ability to recline at up to 135 degrees, and 4D armrests that can be moved in and out or up and down to suit your preferences. Thanks to the fantastic build quality of the DXRacer Craft, all of these features work well and haven't given me any problems."
