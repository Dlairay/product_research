Its infuriating headrest adjustment and lack of any unique features keep it from landing at the top of our list, but it's still quite a comfortable option within its price range.\\n\\nPros\\n\\nGreat build quality\\n\\nPlenty comfortable\\n\\nLots of color and theme options\\n\\nCons\\n\\nAwful headrest adjustment\\n\\nA bit too much front-side branding [...] In terms of functionality, the DXRacer Craft offers pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a mid-range gaming chair. You get standard 2D lumbar support that can be adjusted using a knob on the side of the chair, the ability to recline at up to 135 degrees, and 4D armrests that can be moved in and out or up and down to suit your preferences. Thanks to the fantastic build quality of the DXRacer Craft, all of these features work well and haven't given me any problems.\"}\n",
